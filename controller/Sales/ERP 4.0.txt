ERP 4.0 — Requirement Analysis
Frontend

    1. React (Vite) with TypeScript — major refactor of all pages
    2. Deprecated package cleanup — identify outdated React dependencies and replace with modern alternatives, update related logic
    3. Performance optimization — identify and optimize slow-loading pages
    4. Reuse backend table objects (Sequelize models) on frontend for consistent data structures
    5. Project-module-based file structure organization
    6. JWT authentication integration
    7. New base layout / home wrapper for session maintenance (e.g., Header, Navbar, persistent session state)

Backend
    1. New Menu Management module
    2. Enhanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — driven by new menu masters (module-based access for user / user-type)
    3. User-based API access using menu permissions
    4. Module-based file structure (standardized project structure)
    5. JWT authentication for login & session management
    6. Sequelize ORM integration (database models)
    7. Sequelize-based CRUD APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) — mainly for masters & transactional data (not reports)
    8. Deprecated package cleanup
    9. API performance tuning (with priority on report/generation APIs)
    10. API documentation — Swagger (optional or extend existing doc if already present)

Others
    1. Split Task Management & Tally Integration modules from ERP core
    2. Integrate & validate frontend/backend components delivered by other developers
    3. Testing & test case coverage
